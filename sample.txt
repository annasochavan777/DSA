There are two ways to resume cases: one through the MAX Case Search page and the other by directly amending the case ID in the Full Serve URL. Currently, we are restricting the ability to resume MAE cases via the MAX Case Search page.

Would you like us to also block the ability to resume cases through the Full Serve route? How frequently are cases resumed through Full Serve? Implementing this restriction may require additional time.

Please share your thoughtsâ€”do you want us to block both routes for resuming cases?
