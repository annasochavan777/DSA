Ravindra and I also investigated this issue but were unable to identify why the case was not processed on the same day by the MI Extractor service. This service picks up data from Case Hive and inserts it into the MI instance tables. However, there is no record of any data correction made in Case Hive.

We also reviewed the flat file and event viewer logs, and no exceptions were logged for this case. It appears to be an intermittent issue, so we can ignore it for now. If a similar issue occurs in the future, we can investigate it further.
