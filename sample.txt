I interviewed Rajendra for the .NET Developer position. Unfortunately, his technical knowledge did not meet our expectations for this role.

Here are my observations:

Technical Skills: Lacked a strong understanding of OOP, C#, SQL, and ASP.NET concepts.
Problem-Solving: Struggled to explain or implement solutions effectively.
Coding Ability: Faced difficulty in solving the given coding tasks and was unable to come up with a solution.
Overall Fit: Based on the technical evaluation, I do not recommend proceeding with this candidate.
