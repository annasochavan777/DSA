As part of the Sales Journey Integration (SJI) project, I successfully completed the mapping of SJI request fields to the corresponding MSO data items. This was a critical task to ensure accurate field mapping. Additionally, for any data fields not captured by the SJI UI, I ensured valid default values were set to maintain the integrity of the existing origination functionality.
