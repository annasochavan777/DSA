Sure — here’s a clearer and professionally rephrased version of your note:

Rephrased Version:

The question "Please indicate how you would like to apply for this loan?" is mandatory, but it is currently only visible in MAX screens and not in Origination screens. Based on the value selected for this question, a set of additional questions appear under the Loan Requirements section.

We identified that the value for this data item was missing, which caused the issue. As a temporary fix, we have patched the value of this data item to PRIVATE, and the functionality is now working as expected.

Please note the possible values for this data item in the screenshots provided below. If this question is not available in MAE, we need to default the value of this data item accordingly to prevent similar issues.

Kindly refer to the screenshots for additional context.
