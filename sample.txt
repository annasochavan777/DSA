In regard to the proposed change of modifying the data type of a field from Boolean to a type capable of holding multiple values, we need to emphasize that this represents a significant change from an MSO (Mortgage Servicing Organization) perspective. This field is passed to multiple downstream systems, internal services, and is also stored in the database.

During a previous discussion, we suggested an alternative approach:

Introduce a new field specifically for MAE cases.
Hide the existing Boolean field to minimize the impact on existing systems and processes.
This approach significantly reduces the scope of changes required across downstream systems, internal services, and the database.
