Subject: Impact Assessment and Effort Estimation for Case Requirement Changes

Hi Team,

This is to inform you that the proposed change will be reflected across all channels and journeys, including MAX, BUI, and MAE.

As per the initial assessment (IA), there will be no impact on pipeline cases. However, it is recommended to thoroughly test the case requirements involving changes to the Applicant/Application to ensure stability.

The estimated effort for design, build, and testing activities is approximately 1.5 weeks.

Impacted Component: N4S.MSO.CaseRequirementManager

Please review and let us know if you have any concerns or further inputs.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
