Here's a revised version of your message:

"I have confirmed that for item 69, we need to implement a similar logic as the COT document. Regarding item 75, I don't see any data available at the moment. Ram, could you please create this scenario in SIT so that we can verify the status?"

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
