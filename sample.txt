There are two scenarios where a COT (Change of Terms) can be rejected:

1. **User-Initiated New COT Request:** When a user requests a new COT through the UI, the current COT is automatically rejected. This can be identified by checking if the status has changed from 4 (current status) to 2 (rejected).
   
2. **Underwriter Completes CDU:** In this scenario, the current COT, regardless of its status, will automatically be cancelled when the underwriter completes the CDU process.

Given these scenarios, which event do we want to capture in the apptracking application?
