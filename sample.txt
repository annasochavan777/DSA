Here are some example behaviors and actions that align with Barclays' values of Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence, and Stewardship. You can adapt these examples to fit your personal experiences and work context:

1. Respect

Example: I make an effort to listen actively to all team members during meetings, regardless of their role or seniority, and encourage a culture of open communication where everyone feels their voice is heard. For instance, I ensured that all opinions were taken into account during a recent project design session, leading to a more inclusive solution.


2. Integrity

Example: I take accountability for my work and decisions. When I noticed an error in a report I had submitted, I immediately notified my manager and worked quickly to correct the issue, ensuring that stakeholders were informed before any negative impact could occur. This helped maintain trust and transparency with the team.


3. Service

Example: I go the extra mile to support both internal and external customers. When a customer needed urgent assistance with a mortgage issue, I stayed late to resolve the problem, ensuring their experience was positive and stress-free. This proactive approach helped maintain the customer’s trust in Barclays’ service.


4. Excellence

Example: I consistently seek to improve my performance by learning new technologies and best practices. Recently, I completed a certification in cloud computing which enabled me to optimize a mortgage application process. The new approach reduced processing time by 20%, contributing to team efficiency and customer satisfaction.


5. Stewardship

Example: I actively contribute to Barclays’ long-term success by mentoring junior colleagues, sharing my knowledge, and fostering their development. I also participated in a sustainability initiative within the company, promoting eco-friendly practices such as reducing paper usage in our department, which aligned with Barclays’ commitment to environmental responsibility.


These examples demonstrate how you live the Barclays values in your daily work. You can tailor them based on your specific experiences and responsibilities.
