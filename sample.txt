Sure — let’s incorporate that part naturally into the message as well. Here’s an updated, polished version you can send to HR:

Subject: Resignation Submission, Last Working Day Confirmation, and Pending Formalities

Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to inform you that I have submitted my resignation through the system and have attached a screenshot of the submission for your reference.

As per the system, my last working day is showing as 5th July 2025. I would like to confirm if this is correct and also check if there are any further steps or formalities pending from my side as part of the resignation process. Kindly review and let me know if any additional actions are required, so I can address them accordingly.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Thank you for your assistance.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Employee ID] (if applicable)
