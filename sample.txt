We had a call with the DBA, and after investigation, we discovered that the date-time conversion is failing in the production environment due to a difference in the account-level language settings. In the test environment, it is configured as English, while in production, it is set to British English. Instead of changing the language settings, we can resolve this issue within the SQL query itself by converting the date-time before executing the query.
