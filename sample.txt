Subject: Clarification on Last Working Day and Gratuity Amount Details

Hi [HR's Name],

I hope youâ€™re doing well.

I have a couple of queries and would appreciate your guidance:

As per my resignation, my last working date is showing as 5th July 2025, which falls on a Saturday. Could you please confirm whether my official last working day will be considered as Friday, 4th July 2025 or Monday, 7th July 2025?

I need to declare the gratuity amount in the HGS portal for tax exemption purposes. Could you please let me know where I can check my total eligible gratuity amount for this?

Looking forward to your response.
