Subject: RE: MYIT – A Task TASK2815050

Hi Mehul,

Thank you for your email.

I would like to dispose of the chair myself and will proceed accordingly. Please let me know if you need any further details from my side.

Also, noted your instruction not to close the ticket — I’ll leave it open for the WFH Furniture team to take care of.

Thanks again for your support.

Regards,
Annaso Chavan

Would you like it to sound a bit more formal, casual, or neutral? I can tweak it if you’d like.
