With the implementation of the PD Check automation job, we have significantly reduced the time required for PD checks. Previously, performing manual PD checks for eight components required a minimum of two hours, with four people working in parallel. Now, the automation script generates reports within just four minutes, and two individuals can validate them within 30 minutes.

In past releases, when there were around 30 components, the PD checks took approximately four hours to complete. However, with automation in place, even if the number of components increases in the future, the PD checks can still be completed within 30 to 40 minutes, as the primary task will be validating the reports generated by the script.
