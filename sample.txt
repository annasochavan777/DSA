Sure â€” letâ€™s rephrase the message to clearly describe the testing scenarios based on whatâ€™s in your screenshot. Hereâ€™s a clean, structured version:


---

ðŸ“Œ Testing Scenarios for Case Requirements Change (Applicant to Application)

Scope:
This testing covers the update where selected case requirements are moved from Applicant level to Application level.


---

âœ… Testing Scenarios:

1. Pipeline Cases Testing

Validate all journeys for existing pipeline cases where these case requirements are already present.

Confirm that for these cases, the requirements should continue to behave as they currently do (at Applicant level), even after the change is deployed.



2. New Cases Testing

Test all journeys for newly created cases after the deployment.

Verify that the updated case requirements are now created at the Application level.

Ensure the status behavior for these new requirements is as expected at the Application level.



3. Regression Testing

Perform a full regression to ensure no unintended impact on related functionalities or other journeys due to this change.

Would you like me to help draft a confluence page format or test scenarios in a table format too?
