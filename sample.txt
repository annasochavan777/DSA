After reviewing the code and analyzing the current architecture, it is evident that the existing structure does not support the integration of transformation logic. Implementing this functionality would require significant architectural changes. To ensure the feasibility of this solution, we need to conduct a proof of concept (POC) to gain confidence in its effectiveness. Given the scope of these changes, we estimate that the entire effort—including development, CIT, and testing—will take approximately five weeks to complete.
