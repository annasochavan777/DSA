Hereâ€™s a rephrased version of your message:


---

We have the Barclays.MSO.RWEAutomationService running on the Support1 server, which uses the SVC_CLI_MSOAPPS_STN4 account. This account is managed by CA, and we encountered the following error on CA:

Error:
Automatic management for this account was disabled by CPM.
Failed to open the Barclays.MSO.RWEAutomationService on GWDKBC04WEB0048.o.client.barclayscorp.com using the user SVC_CLI_CARECON4 at the domain CLIENT.BARCLAYSCORP.COM.
Error 183: Cannot create a file when that file already exists.

It appears that the password for this account was not updated, leading to a failure when attempting to start services, including RWEAutomationService, which resulted in the service account being locked.

Resolution:

We updated the RWEAutomationService with the correct password and restarted all services. However, CPM was not enabled on CA, and we will review the RWEAutomationService configuration on CA as well.
