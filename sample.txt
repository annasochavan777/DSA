The error message "Exception processing message unexpected parameters" typically appears when there is an issue with the zip file or the way it's being processed. You could rephrase the error description as follows:

"I am encountering an issue while selecting or attempting to unzip a zip file. The system throws an exception with the message: 'Exception processing message - unexpected parameters.'"

This helps describe the situation more clearly. For debugging, you might want to check the following:

Ensure the zip file is not corrupted.

Try unzipping the file using a different tool.

Check if the zip file is password-protected or has special characters in its name, which might be causing the issue.
