While working on resolving the JIRA-3421 issue, we unintentionally caused this new issue. The current query only shows records when the valuation report is received, but it doesnâ€™t display entries where valuation is instructed. I have made the necessary changes to fix this. Harshal, please make the required adjustments on your end.
