Subject: Thank You and Farewell

Dear Team,

As many of you know, today marks my last working day at Barclays. Itâ€™s a bittersweet moment for me as I wrap up a wonderful 8-year journey with an organization that has been more than just a workplace â€” itâ€™s been a family, a learning ground, and a source of countless memories over the years.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you for your support, encouragement, and camaraderie. I have thoroughly enjoyed working alongside such a talented, collaborative, and dedicated group of individuals. The knowledge, friendships, and experiences Iâ€™ve gained here will stay with me throughout my career and beyond.

A special thanks to my mentors, managers, and teammates for always being approachable, supportive, and for creating an environment where learning and growth felt natural.

Though Iâ€™m excited to embark on a new chapter, Iâ€™ll truly miss the meaningful interactions, teamwork, and of course, the fun moments weâ€™ve shared.

Please feel free to stay connected â€” I would love to keep in touch!

Thank you once again for everything!

Warm regards,
Annaso Chavan
