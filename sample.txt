Enhancing DevOps Efficiency and Automation for the MAE Application : I took ownership of the DevOps initiatives for the new MAE application by creating a robust CI/CD pipeline, ensuring seamless integration and continuous deployment. Additionally, I developed and implemented a Chef recipe to automate the hosting of the MAE website on IIS, streamlining the deployment process and reducing manual effort. These actions significantly improved the efficiency of our delivery pipeline, allowing the team to deploy updates faster and with greater consistency.
