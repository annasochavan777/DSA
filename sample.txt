The MI Extractor service successfully processed this case on November 27th at 8:54 AM. The service’s primary function is to replicate cases from the main database instance to the MI database instance. However, we still don’t have a clear explanation for the delay in processing this case. I am currently investigating the issue to determine the cause.
