Sure — here’s a clear and professional rephrased version of your message:

We won’t be able to test this scenario as the eChannel setup is not available in the SIT1 environment. Because of this, we cannot modify the certificate name.

If we update it for the enquiry service, the service call would work correctly, but you would no longer be able to log in via IntAuth, as TIAA requires a different certificate for authentication.

In the production environment, the configuration is different — the TIAA certificate is configured in the Max config on the eChannel server, while the internal server uses a separate certificate for the enquiry service.
