The customer.1.correspondanceaddress.line3 field is mapped to the 'Street' field on the MSO side. However, currently, the data is being sent inside customer.1.correspondanceaddress.line2, due to which it is not getting displayed on MSO.
To resolve this, please correct the mapping and ensure the data meant for the 'Street' field is sent inside customer.1.correspondanceaddress.line3
