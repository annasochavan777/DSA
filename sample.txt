To resolve this issue permanently, I am working on a query to eliminate the dependency on the MI Extractor service. Currently, we are using the MI-application table to filter out intermediary cases. However, there is another table, 'Channel,' which contains the exact same information, replicated through actual data synchronization. I will update you once the new query is ready.
