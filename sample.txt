As part of the Sales Journey Integration (SJI) project, I successfully completed the mapping of SJI request fields to the corresponding MSO data items. This was a critical task to ensure accurate field mapping. Additionally, for any data fields not captured by the SJI UI, I ensured valid default values were set to maintain the integrity of the existing origination functionality.

In SJI, around 120 new fields were introduced, and as part of the Case Data Update (CDU) requirement, the business requested that a revised offer be triggered if changes were made to specific data items within these newly added fields. Additionally, they wanted the package and access workflow to be triggered based on changes to certain data items. To fulfill this requirement, I implemented the necessary changes in CDU.

During SIT testing, I provided support by analyzing the root cause of defects raised and resolving them.

As the MAE is being developed, there are times when the team needs to understand how the existing Max functionality works in specific scenarios. I assist by explaining the current Max logic to help them replicate it on their end. These discussions are held with the stakeholders.

The new MAE gateway service currently uses certificate-based authentication, but to enhance security, I have implemented token-based authentication. For this, I utilized TIAA authentication, which is the standard at Barclays.


Drive continuous improvement: Regularly review project outcomes to identify lessons learned and areas for further enhancement.
  • Implemented token-based authentication for the new MAE gateway service to enhance security, replacing the existing certificate-based authentication.
	•	Leveraged TIAA authentication, the standard at Barclays, to ensure compliance with best practices, resulting in a more secure and resilient system.
	•	This initiative reflects a commitment to improving security measures and aligning with industry standards, driving overall system improvement.
