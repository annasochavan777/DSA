Issue Background:
We observed in production that the MI Extractor service processed two cases with a delay of around 12 hours. Currently, we rely on the MI-application table to filter intermediary cases, which creates a dependency on the MI Extractor service.

Resolution:
To eliminate this dependency, we plan to use the 'Channel' table, which contains the same information as the MI-application table through data replication. I am working on a query to implement this solution and will provide an update once it is ready.
