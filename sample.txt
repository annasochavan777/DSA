As part of the Sales Journey Integration (SJI) project, I successfully completed the mapping of SJI request fields to the corresponding MSO data items. This was a critical task to ensure accurate field mapping. Additionally, for any data fields not captured by the SJI UI, I ensured valid default values were set to maintain the integrity of the existing origination functionality.


In Origination, as part of the Case Data Update (CDU) requirement, the business requested that a revised offer be triggered if any changes were made to specific data items in newly added fields. To meet this requirement, I implemented the necessary changes in CDU.
