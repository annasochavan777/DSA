Of course — here’s your rephrased message with your mother instead of yourself:

Option 1 (Formal & Simple)

> My mother is not feeling well as she has been down with cold and fever since last night. I will be taking a day off today to take care of her.




---

Option 2 (Crisp & Professional)

> As my mother has been unwell with cold and fever since last night, I will be taking a leave today to attend to her.




---

Option 3 (Casual & Friendly)

> My mother is unwell since last night due to cold and fever. I’ll be taking the day off today to look after her.

Would you like it framed as a mail format too? I can draft that for you as well.
