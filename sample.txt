After a thorough investigation, I identified the root cause of the issue in the case file query. The problem was due to incorrect filtering logic in the WHERE clause, which caused duplicate records to appear.

I have fixed the query and completed testing in the test environment. The updated query is producing the expected results.

@Harshal - Please find the attached updated query.
@Ankita - We need to execute a few test case scenarios in SIT before moving this query to the production environment.
