Subject: Compatibility Issue with Null-Conditional Operator (?.) in .NET 3.5

Hi Team,

As discussed in the code review call, we cannot implement null condition handling using the null-conditional (?.) operator due to compatibility restrictions with .NET Framework 3.5.

Key Points:

1. Null-conditional (?.) was introduced in C# 6.0, which requires at least .NET Framework 4.5 or later.


2. Our project targets .NET Framework 3.5, which does not support C# 6.0 features.


3. MSBuild 14.0 allows compiling C# 6.0 code, but the actual runtime (CLR 2.0 used in .NET 3.5) does not recognize these new language features, leading to potential runtime issues.



Impact:

If we introduce ?., developers using older compilers may face build issues.

It may lead to unexpected runtime failures in environments that strictly require .NET 3.5.


Alternative Approach:

To maintain compatibility, we should use traditional null checks, like:

// Instead of:
int? length = person?.Name?.Length;

// Use:
int? length = (person != null && person.Name != null) ? person.Name.Length : (int?)null;

This ensures our code runs correctly across all supported environments.

If there is a plan to upgrade to a newer .NET Framework version (4.5 or later), we can revisit this improvement in the future.

Let me know if you have any questions.
