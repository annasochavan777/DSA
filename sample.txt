Here’s a revised version of your request:

"Mso is receiving a null response during the TIAA pickup for this reference ID. I’d like to confirm which TIAA URL is configured on the BDN API side, as Salesforce is sending the data to TIAA through this API. Do we have a point of contact from that team who can assist?"
