We have identified the root cause of the issue. Recently, the SIT3 database was migrated, but this update was not communicated to the ETL team. As a result, the ETL jobs continued pointing to the old database instance, which is why no cases were extracted. Ideally, the DB migration team should have informed all impacted teams about this change. Akshay is now updating their jobs to point to the new database instance and will perform a test run.
