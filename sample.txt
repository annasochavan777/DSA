Subject: IT Equipment Return Confirmation

Dear Team,

I would like to inform you that I will be returning all my allocated IT equipment today as part of my exit formalities.

Please let me know if any further action is required from my end.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Annaso Chavan
