To address the issue permanently, we are working on a query to eliminate the dependency on the MI Extractor service. Currently, we are using the MI-application table to filter intermediary cases, but we have observed in production that two cases were processed with a delay of around 12 hours by the MI Extractor service. To resolve this, we plan to use the 'Channel' table, which contains the same information replicated through actual data synchronization. I will update you once the new query is ready.
