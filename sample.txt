I have analyzed this issue from my end. Apart from the XO channel case, I have assessed the other cases. Essentially, the source system value is stored in two places: the caseMeta table in the database and case hive. For these cases, the source system value is present in case hive, but at the same time, the caseMeta table holds a null value. This suggests that something might be happening while storing this value in the caseMeta table. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause.
