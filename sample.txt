Please ensure the following two scenarios are tested to confirm that the changes are working correctly:

	1.	Test one case with valuation marked as “instructed.”
	2.	Test another case with the valuation report marked as “received.”

If you want to add any other scenarios, that’s fine, but at least these two must be tested. I don’t see these changes will have any other impact.
