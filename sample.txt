Sure — here’s a clear and polished rephrased version of your message:

I have been facing frequent connectivity issues while working from my hometown. I'm unable to consistently join calls, and even when I manage to connect, the calls often get disconnected unexpectedly.

I will be back in the office from next week onwards, and I’ll schedule all the pending KT sessions accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding.
