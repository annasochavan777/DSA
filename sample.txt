I am always striving to improve my skills by learning new technologies and best practices. Recently, I completed a course on Java Spring Boot and React 17 through Pluralsight, which has deepened my understanding of the new MAE mortgage application we are developing. This ensures that I am well-prepared to provide support whenever needed and can contribute more effectively to the project.
