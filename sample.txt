We tested a scenario in the test environment where we updated the mobile number field from Salesforce (refer to the screenshot below). After that, we created a case in MAX using the same broker, and the following was observed:

In MAX, on the Introducer Details screen, the mobile number is populated from the Get Broker response.

When clicking Next, a validation is triggered on this field. The system does not allow the user to proceed further until the mobile number is updated to a valid format.
